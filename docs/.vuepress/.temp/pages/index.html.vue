<pre>Hi, and welcome to my website. I'd to keep my introduction simple: </pre>
<pre>   I'm a programmer. </pre> <br>
<pre>There is nothing more needed to be said. </pre>
<h3 id="can-you-at-least-elaborate-more-on-who-you-are" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-you-at-least-elaborate-more-on-who-you-are"><span>Can you at least elaborate more on who you are?</span></a></h3>
<p>There is a lot I can talk about. But I'll break it up into two sections, <br>
professional career and a personal experience.</p>
<h4 id="professional-career" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#professional-career"><span>Professional Career</span></a></h4>
<p>Currently I'm a engineer at General Dynamics Electric Boat. I worked <br>
previously at IT Recovery specialist doing hardware recycling.</p>
<p>Now one of the things you may have noticed is that I worked in New York City. <br>
I used to live in New York City. Some of my work experience was from when I <br>
was in high school. I started by volunteering at NYC+HHC hospitals <br>
doing administrative tasking. I was mostly working with the facilities <br>
maintenance department.</p>
<h4 id="personal-experience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-experience"><span>Personal Experience</span></a></h4>
<p>I like to program on hardware. For me doing programming on an arduino is <br>
what really made me appreciate programming more. I will admit that I'm not <br>
the 0.01% of programmers. But I think pragmatic solutions tend to be the <br>
best solutions so everyone can understand.<br></p>
