### Salutations and Greetings 
<pre>Hi, and welcome to my website. I'd to keep my introduction simple: </pre>

<pre>   I'm a programmer. </pre> <br>
<pre>There is nothing more needed to be said. </pre>

### Can you at least elaborate more on who you are?
There is a lot I can talk about. But I'll break it up into two sections, <br>
professional career and a personal experience.

#### Professional Career
Currently I'm a engineer at General Dynamics Electric Boat. I worked <br>
previously at IT Recovery specialist doing hardware recycling.

Now one of the things you may have noticed is that I worked in New York City. <br>
I used to live in New York City. Some of my work experience was from when I <br>
was in high school. I started by volunteering at NYC+HHC hospitals <br>
doing administrative tasking. I was mostly working with the facilities <br>
maintenance department.

#### Personal Experience
I like to program on hardware. For me doing programming on an arduino is <br>
what really made me appreciate programming more. I will admit that I'm not <br>
the 0.01% of programmers. But I think pragmatic solutions tend to be the <br>
best solutions so everyone can understand.<br>
